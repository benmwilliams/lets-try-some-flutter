Listened to an episode of SE daily with the head of the Flutter team and it was interesting af. Never done any kind of mobile development, but flutter seems really exciting, and I have to do something to keep my brain in the right place while I build a wordpress plugin for my 9-5

For now, I'm going through the 'getting started' project on flutter.io, maybe it will turn into something. It's certainly exciting to think about what is possible with all the features related to a mobile device that you can access that you can't from the web.
